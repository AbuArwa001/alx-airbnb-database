1. # Write Complex Queries with Joins
# Objective
    Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins
## Instructions:

    Write a query using an `INNER JOIN` to retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

    Write a query using a `LEFT JOIN` to retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

    Write a query using a `FULL OUTER JOIN` to retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

2. # Practice Subqueries

    Objective: Write both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.

## Instructions:

    Write a query to find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0 using a subquery.

    Write a correlated subquery to find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

3. Apply Aggregations and Window Functions

**Objective**: Use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.

### Instructions:

Write a query to find the total number of bookings made by each user, using the COUNT function and GROUP BY clause.

Use a window function (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) to rank properties based on the total number of bookings they have received.

4. Objective: Refactor complex queries to improve performance.

## Instructions:

Write an initial query that retrieves all bookings along with the user details, property details, and payment details and save it on perfomance.sql

    Analyze the queryâ€™s performance using EXPLAIN and identify any inefficiencies.

    Refactor the query to reduce execution time, such as reducing unnecessary joins or using indexing.
