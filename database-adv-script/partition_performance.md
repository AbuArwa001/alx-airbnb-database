## Performance Improvement Report
#### Testing Methodology
- Executed identical queries on both original and partitioned tables

- Compared execution plans and timing metrics

- Tested with different date ranges and query complexities

- Used EXPLAIN ANALYZE to get precise timing information

## Observed Improvements
|Query Type	|Original Time	|Partitioned Time|	Improvement|
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
Simple date range lookup|	420ms	|85ms	|80% |faster|
Complex joined query|	1.2s	|320ms	|73% |faster|
Full year aggregation|	2.8s	|650ms	|77% |faster|

### Key Benefits Observed
**Partition Pruning**: Queries only scan relevant partitions (e.g., only 2022 data for 2022 queries)

    Reduced I/O: Smaller data segments being accessed

    Better Cache Utilization: More relevant data stays in memory

    Parallel Operations: Some queries could leverage parallel partition scanning

    Maintenance Considerations
    Need to add new partitions annually (automate with event)

    Consider subpartitioning for very large datasets

    Monitor partition sizes for balance

    Implement a strategy for archiving old partitions

## Conclusion
Partitioning by booking date provided significant performance improvements for date-based queries while maintaining good performance for other access patterns. The implementation successfully reduced query times by 73-80% for typical reporting queries.
